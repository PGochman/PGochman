<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pedro Gochman</h1>
<h3 align="center">A full stack developer from Argentina</h3>

<h2>About me:</h2>
<h4>I studied architecture in high school and electronic engineering in college. Throughout the three years of my college education, I developed a strong interest in programming, leading me to decide to focus solely on studying that.

For my initial educational experience, I attended a programming bootcamp called Soy Henry, where I learned full-stack web development and various technologies associated with it, such as React, Redux, Next, Tailwind, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, etc. Additionally, during the bootcamp, I completed my first two projects, which reinforced my knowledge and allowed me to explore new territories. Collaborating with a team on these projects taught me valuable lessons about working on a project collectively.

Currently, I am actively seeking my first professional experience while planning to continue my education and self-improvement to become a better programmer every day.</h4>
